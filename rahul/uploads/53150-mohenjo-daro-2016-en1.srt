(Ancient Sindhu language)

6
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,792
because...

7
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:14,833
these brave young men have saved
Amri village from that monstrous crocodile.

8
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,375
Many many thanks, Sarman!

9
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,958
Sarman...

10
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,167
may your strength grow hundred fold!

11
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,958
Bima!

12
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,250
Why does it always have to be you?

13
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,250
Is there no one else in the village?

14
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,625
Every time Amri has a problem,
why are you expected to solve it?

15
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,750
It's the truth!

16
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,708
When the river changes course...

17
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,583
Sarman must find a way
to direct water into our fields.

18
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,208
When to plough the fields,
when to sow the seeds...

19
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,333
when will it rain?
As if without Sarman's permission...

20
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,542
the sun and the moon
will not rise in Amri.

21
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,750
Now now, you should be proud,
but instead, you are scolding him.

22
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,708
Aunt Bima,
if I can help, then why should I not?

23
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:34,292
I was worried to death today
thinking about you and that beast.

24
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,542
Do not worry about me so much!

25
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,625
Aunt Bima, you often hum this tune.

26
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,250
This tune...
it does not belong to Amri, does it?

27
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:49,500
Aunt Bima, have you ever
seen a one-horned animal?

28
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,417
Deer like? With a long,
pointed horn on its forehead?

29
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:57,625
Why do you ask?

30
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,667
I saw it in my dream.

31
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,833
It was just that - a dream!
Now get ready...

32
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,583
your Uncle must be waiting
for you in the fields.

33
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,167
The indigo crop has not
been good this year, Sarman.

34
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,167
Far away, when the
Sindhu changes course...

35
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,667
then our River Nara also
moves away from our village.

36
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,917
How will the crops grow?

37
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,167
Uncle, may I ask you a question?

38
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,333
<i>Moherfyo Datum'?</i>

39
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,292
Everyone is leaving tomorrow.

40
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,875
This time let me go
with them for the bazaar.

41
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,833
You have asked the same question
for the past three monsoons now.

42
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,333
I am tired listening to it,
are you not tired of asking?

43
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,833
Until you say yes,
I will keep asking.

44
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,083
Uncle I want to travel
to the far off lands.

45
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,458
Which part does the sun rise from?

46
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,250
Which part does it set?

47
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,500
How far does the light fall?

48
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,750
I want to see all that Uncle.

49
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,417
A bird's offspring
should not leave its nest...

50
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,500
until it's ready to fly, Sarman.

51
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,542
Sarman... won't you eat?

52
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,750
What happened?

53
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,583
Once again he is insisting
on going to Mohenjo Daro!

54
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,000
He is upset because I said no.

55
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,417
His anger is like a dew drop,
it will evaporate in no time.

56
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,667
But...

57
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,958
how long can we stop him, Durjan?

58
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,250
As long as possible!

59
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,542
He was asking me
about the Unicorn earlier.

60
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,625
I just don't understand!

61
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,625
What is it about Mohenjo Daro
that makes Uncle so restless?

62
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,292
He is afraid that if you
go there, you will settle down.

63
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Hojo, do you not feel like seeing it?

64
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,792
What?

65
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,125
What the land outside Amri is like.

66
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,000
What the people are like?

67
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,583
What the girls must be like?

68
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,583
You have not found
a single girl in Amri that you like.

69
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,333
What makes you think the girls
in Mohenjo Daro will be any different?

70
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,792
How would I know?

71
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,083
But my heart tells me that
the girl who will be my companion...

72
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,542
there will be no other
like her in all of Sindhu Land.

73
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,917
Then your meeting has
already failed to happen.

74
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,167
Every year, before the bazaar,
it is the same story.

75
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,292
Uncle does not
want you to go, Sarman.

76
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,667
Leave this obsession.

77
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,458
But I want to see Mohenjo Daro, Hojo!

78
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,583
So now what? You want to fly
to Mohenjo Daro like the birds do?

79
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,917
What happened?
Crocodile?!

80
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,792
The sun has yet to rise!

81
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,125
- Let's go!
- Let's go? Where?

82
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:12,708
Mohenjo Daro!

83
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,833
Mohenj0...? Without telling anyone?

84
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,083
What if your Uncle...
what if my Mom and Dad find out?

85
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,375
It's alright. Come on...

86
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:38,333
<i>Barter 'vs not easy 'm Moheflyo Dare.</i>

87
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,792
Pay close attention
to what I am about to say.

88
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,333
Tell me, Uncle.

89
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,208
Whatever happens,
do not drop the value of the goods.

90
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,625
Mohenjo Daro is very
different from Amri.

91
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,042
The city is full of greed,
not people.

92
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,500
Be careful always...

93
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,417
and do not trust
a stranger to be your friend.

94
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,208
Do not worry, Uncle!

95
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,625
Hojo will keep an eye on Sarman.

96
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,042
Phum.

97
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,167
Till today you have been
trading for me.

98
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,042
This time Sarman will go,
I can no longer stop him.

99
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,917
- Look after him.
- Right.

100
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,167
Here is some food.

101
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,417
Take care!

102
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,458
Keep this with you.

103
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:14,792
Open it only when it's
a matter of life and death! Promise me!

104
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,833
Hojo.

105
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,375
Mohenjo Daro!

106
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,708
And that is our Holy River,
Mother Sindhu!

107
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:06,333
The South Gate is
for foreign traders...

108
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,083
and their living quarters will be
along the walls of the South Gate.

109
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,917
The East Gate and the North Gate
are for the citizens of Mohenjo Daro.

110
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,750
How was this built?

111
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,083
What is that symbol, Uncle Phulji?

112
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,417
Six creatures' symbol! It represents
the six great cities of Sindhu Land.

113
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,167
Each creature acts
as a symbol of a city.

114
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,125
And which animal is that?
With one horn?

115
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,792
That's a Unicorn, Sarman.

116
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,792
The purest animal
in the Order of the Sindhu...

117
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:39,542
the symbol of Mohenjo Daro!

118
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,417
Bull cart riders, go inside
and get your token for trade.

119
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,167
Two indigo sacks from Amri as tax!

120
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,792
Where does our indigo tax go?

121
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,583
Take this!

122
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,458
I thank you.

123
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,667
You?!
Why have you come here?

124
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,917
- Listen...
- Go back!

125
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,458
Listen to me...

126
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:43,625
this... this city is full of greed...

127
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,750
this is a land of thieves!

128
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,792
Save yourself! Or you will burn...

129
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
- Go away!
- Jakhiro!

130
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,250
Step aside! Let the traders through.

131
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,917
Do not frighten them.
Move!

132
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,583
Go away!

133
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,750
Return!

134
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,042
Who is that?

135
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,958
His name is Jakhiro.

136
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,583
It pains me to shoo him away.
People call him a madman!

137
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,708
But it was the ancestors
of this very madman...

138
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,500
who laid the foundations
of this great city!

139
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,417
And once, he was
highly respected in the Senate!

140
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,750
Sarman! There are houses
on top of each other!

141
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,417
It feels as if I have seen
all this before. I do not understand.

142
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,375
But I do know this...

143
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:09,208
it is exactly
as I had imagined it would be.

144
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:15,542
Even I feel the same! As if I was
born to be here! Just look at them!

145
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,833
We have come here only for trade!
Do not forget!

146
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,458
But I'm doing just that...

147
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,583
I'm trading my heart!

148
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,250
Idiot!

149
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,750
Colorful beauties...
from the land of Dilmoon!

150
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,583
The skull of a Zebu bull!

151
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:54,083
Quickly, find a place for your stall
or you will be left standing.

152
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,250
Hurry up...

153
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,667
Stop!

154
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,250
Quickly, quickly!

155
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,292
If the bazaar has any sparkle this year
it's because of those foreign traders!

156
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,042
Foreign traders? Where?

157
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,167
That group with the tall hats...
they are from Dilmoon!

158
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,542
They trade the goods that they
acquire here, in faraway lands.

159
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,250
They are Makkans - their ships
are said to be so big that...

160
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,292
they can easily carry a
hundred travellers across the sea...

161
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,000
and it takes them some
twenty suns to reach Makkan.

162
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,417
Twenty suns?! Do their ships
not fall off at the edge of the sea?

163
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,042
Only those who have
travelled, would know.

164
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:02,625
And they are from Bukhara -
the faraway lands in the cold North.

165
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,792
But what is this strange
creature they bring with them?

166
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,167
Does it give milk?

167
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,292
No, not milk,
it runs fast, helps travel.

168
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,417
- What is it called?
- Hor-se!

169
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,250
Hor-se!

170
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:25,583
One hour has passed!

171
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:32,375
Use this indigo to color your clothes
or paint it on your walls... take it!

172
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,292
We will give you 8 sacks
of wheat for 3 sacks of indigo.

173
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,417
No, I cannot accept
less than 1O sacks of wheat!

174
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,375
No, not 10... 8 sacks!

175
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,167
Please, take a look at the quality.

176
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:48,167
Highest class of seeds, sown
and harvested at the right time...

177
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,042
watered by the pure Nara river and
grown with the love of Amri village.

178
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,542
These are the qualities of my indigo.

179
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,542
That is why I cannot accept
less than 1O sacks of wheat.

180
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,375
Listen!

181
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,458
Take whatever they are offering,
the market is slow this time.

182
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,000
They will barter elsewhere.

183
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,458
Sarman, don't forget what Uncle
had said... don't drop the value!

184
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:14,000
But there is an abundance of traders,
then why is the market slow?

185
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,375
Traders are here to take
advantage of the farmers!

186
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:22,375
The dam on the Sindhu river
is affecting the entire region.

187
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:24,167
Dam?

188
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,625
Wait... wait!

189
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,333
Hojo, seal the deal
with 8 sacks of wheat!

190
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,500
Right!

191
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,750
<i>Elephant tusks for your home!</i>

192
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,875
- I thank you.
- I am Lothar, a guard of Mohenjo Daro.

193
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,042
You gave your shawl
to that madman Jakhiro.

194
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,958
No one here does that.

195
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,250
No... no, please don't do this!

196
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,542
We are weavers from Kot Diji.
Sindhu river changed course...

197
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:07,625
and swept away our village,
our homes, our fields, everything.

198
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,875
Now there is no food to eat,
even the woven cloth was swept away.

199
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,792
This is Moonja,
the Senate Chief Maham's son!

200
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:19,500
A few cloth bundles and
threads is all that we have.

201
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,292
If we get 4 Lapis Lazuli in
return for our cloth...

202
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,000
our villagers
will be able to sustain.

203
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:31,250
Look weaver...
the fair value is 2 Lapis Lazuli.

204
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,083
If you want 4...

205
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:40,542
then you will have to send your
women every night to me, one by one.

206
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,417
Take back your words or-

207
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,917
The value of these goods
is 4 Lapis Lazuli...

208
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:58,792
if you do not accept...
then there is no barter.

209
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:03,167
Oh really! Who are you?
Do you know who I am?

210
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,458
Who you are or who I am,
does not matter!

211
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There is only one rule of barter -
fair exchange!

212
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,250
Here fair is, what I deem fair!

213
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,958
4 Lapis Lazuli...

214
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,583
not one more, not one less...

215
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,917
or there is no deal.

216
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,958
What's going on here?

217
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,667
All traders return to your stalls.

218
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,750
Move! Go!

219
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:36,167
Seal the deal at 2 Lapis Lazuli!
The master is not used to bickering.

220
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,958
Forgive him master,
he is not from the city.

221
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:42,000
He is unaware
of the rules of Mohenjo Daro.

222
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,708
<i>2</i> Lapis Lazuli!
Load the goods in the cart behind.

223
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:13,583
That was close.
Do not repeat what you just did!

224
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,458
I may not be able
to save you the next time.

225
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,167
Remember, this is not your village!

226
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,458
I too am a farmer!

227
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,083
I know the hardwork
that goes into harvesting crops.

228
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,792
And then, he spoke of the women
as if they were goods for barter.

229
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,208
How could I have remained silent?

230
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:35,167
The bazaar is meant
for exchanging wares...

231
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,917
for our livelihood.

232
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,542
Uncle was right...
this city is full of greed!

233
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Hojo! Pack your goods!

234
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:48,167
I refuse to stay in a place
where the air is impure.

235
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,583
- We will return to Amri!
- Go back?

236
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,333
If we return without the Zebu bulls,
Uncle will harness me to the plough!

237
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,792
Take a deep breath Sarman,
maybe the air will become pure again?

238
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:40,667
That is Chaani.
The daughter of our Priest.

239
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,917
Why is everyone bowing to her?

240
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,583
She is a symbol of Mother Sindhu's
Grace and Blessing on this city.

241
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:53,417
They say that Chaani's birth foretells the
coming of a New Order for Mohenjo Daro.

242
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:55,917
New Order?

243
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,958
Chaani, look at that!

244
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,292
Apologise to Junu!

245
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,208
Let it go, Chaani.

246
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,250
Did you not hear me?

247
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,375
Apologise!

248
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,000
Or else...

249
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,292
I will turn you into a toad!

250
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,083
A toad?

251
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,958
This is my final warning!

252
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,250
If you do not apologise...

253
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:40,042
I will turn you into a toad.

254
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,208
Seems like he is an outsider.

255
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,750
The Chosen One has never been wrong!

256
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:48,792
She has powers! She has been
granted a boon by Mother Sindhu!

257
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,417
Please forgive me!

258
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:02,917
Seems like she really is
blessed by Mother Sindhu.

259
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:11,708
Chaani... I did not know
you can turn a man into a toad!

260
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:18,208
Does the rain fall because I say so?
I was just trying to scare him...

261
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,125
but you got scared instead.

262
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,792
Stop staring!

263
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:19,667
"Hojo! Pack your goods! I refuse to
stay in a place where the air is impure."

264
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:24,500
You were right, Sarman. We should
pack our stuff, let's return to Amri.

265
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:28,375
So should we leave? Or has the air
in Mohenjo Daro become pure suddenly?

266
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,792
Has the sparkle returned?

267
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,333
Idiot!

268
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:41,583
Senate Chief Maham welcomes all
traders to the Mohenjo Daro bazaar!

269
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:46,750
Maham wants the trade to increase
this year and has always worked...

270
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:51,958
towards the betterment of
this great city of Sindhu Land!

271
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,000
Chiefs!

272
00:29:55,333 --> 00:30:01,417
The promise that I had made
to Mohenjo Daro 15 monsoons ago...

273
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,667
has now been fulfilled.

274
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:09,792
For a long time
Harappa was ahead of us.

275
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:16,542
Where only Harappa was looked
at for trade, in all of Sindhu Land...

276
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:21,000
it is now Mohenjo Daro
that every trader looks forward to.

277
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:26,000
I will soon destroy Harappa!

278
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,958
This Senate does not
agree with your rules, Maham!

279
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,542
Whatever may be the reasons
for Harappa's downfall...

280
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,792
surely, the reason for Mohenjo
Dar0's downfall will be you, Maham!

281
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,375
Has destroying Harappa's trade
improved the lives of this city?

282
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,500
No!

283
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:47,208
By constructing a dam on the Sindhu,
have we achieved anything?

284
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,292
No!

285
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,333
The streets and the walls
in the Lower City are crumbling!

286
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:54,958
Have they been fixed?
No!

287
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:05,417
In order to improve the Lower City,
we need resources...

288
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,750
which we do not have!

289
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:13,958
I propose an increase
in tax from the people.

290
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,042
Senate Chief Maham!

291
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:21,333
For 15 monsoons, the people have suffered
the consequences of your actions.

292
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:26,125
Chiefs!
To fight injustice is justice itself!

293
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,625
You are silent, because you do not
know the truth about Maham!

294
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,042
You do not know the real reason
why he was forced to leave Harappa.

295
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,417
That is false!
Chief of Farmers!

296
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:42,750
Remember, there is only one punishment
for disrespecting Senate Chief Maham.

297
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:47,583
Whoever is in favor of increasing
the tax, raise your palms...

298
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,875
those against, show your fists!

299
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:55,167
- Chief of Miners.
- Chief of Guards.

300
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,625
- Chief of Artists.
- Chief of Potters.

301
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,250
- Chief of Fishermen.
- Chief of Brick Makers.

302
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,167
- Chief of Bead Makers.
- Chief of Cattle Herders.

303
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,875
- Chief of Land Owners.
- Chief of Weavers.

304
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,500
- Chief of Dyers.
- Chief of Merchants.

305
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:12,750
Chief of Farmers!

306
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,000
The tax... will be increased!

307
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,833
The assembly has concluded.

308
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:32,708
Chief of Farmers!
Our conversation has not yet ended.

309
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:45,917
Speak up! What still remains
to be said, Senate Chief?

310
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,875
What is it that you know
that the other Chiefs do not?

311
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:56,333
The real reason for your
banishment from Harappa!

312
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,375
Let it be known to all the Chiefs...

313
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:10,417
that the Chief of Merchants, Maham,
has smuggled timber to the Sumerians.

314
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,042
In exchange, we reaped the benefit!

315
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:16,417
As punishment for this crime, I decree
that Maham be banished from Harappa.

316
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,958
Leave the city!

317
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,667
That day I vowed...

318
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,375
I will take revenge for
my humiliation and bring Harappa to ruin.

319
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,333
Ruin Harrappa? -

320
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:07,542
It is only me who decides, who will
live and who will die in Mohenjo Daro!

321
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,958
And you... will not live.

322
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,917
Yours will be a lonely death,
O Chief of Farmers!

323
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:27,958
You will be unable to protest again,
in any Senate!

324
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,125
Senate Chief Maham!

325
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:59,625

Lothar...

374
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:07,042
does the Priest
live in the Upper City?

375
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,292
Yes.

376
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,125
Can you take us there?

377
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:14,708
No Sarman, the entry is restricted
for people of the Lower City.

378
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:19,500
Only those who have a special copper
seal are allowed inside the gate.

379

Will this seal do?

380
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,292
How did you get this seal?

381
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,542
What are you doing, Sarman?

382
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:33,292
Uncle had said only in
times of life and death!

383
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,542
It is life and death, Hojo!

384
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,750
I have to find her!

385
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:42,000
Try to look like you're
from the Upper City.

386
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,208
Why is it taking so long today?

387
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,750
Right.

388
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,958
It feels like we have
entered a different city.

389
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:43,792
There she is!

390
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,792
The man in the saffron clothing
is her father, the Priest.

391
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:01,125
There... you saw her!
Has your heart fluttered enough?

392
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,583
Now can we go back?

393
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:05,708
Easy!

394
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,375
Easy!

395
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,708
Look into my eyes!

396
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,292
Look into my eyes!

397
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,083
Easy!

398
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,375
I thank you!

399
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,417
Who are you?

400
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,125
Chaani! Are you alright?

401
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,458
I thank you!

402
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:30,667
You saved my daughter.

403
00:46:30,917 --> 00:46:33,667
You handled the situation bravely!
What is your name?

404
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,708
You don't look like
you're from around here.

405
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,500
My name is Sarman.

406
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:40,667
I'm an indigo farmer.

407
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,792
I've come from Amri.

408
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:57,083
Perhaps it is Mother Sindhu's wish
that you are here!

409
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,917
- Now you better not turn and look!
- Why will I look back?!

410
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,417
But tell me if she does!

411
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:24,792
She - the Chosen One of Mohenjo Daro
and you - an ordinary farmer from Amri!

412
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,875
She turning back is like
the sun and the moon rising together.

413
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,042
What an unpredictable city!

414
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,667
You cannot even trust
the sun and the moon here!

415
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,125
One bag of yam
in exchange for one bag of indigo.

416
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,542
Sarman, is one bag of yam acceptable?

417
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,542
Sarman! If you continue daydreaming,
we will lose the traders!

418
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:15,917
It's the last day today...

419
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,667
we have to finish exchanging
the last of our goods.

420
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,917
Plagued by love... what else?

421
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,958
It turns even the wisest men
into fools!

422
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,125
Hojo, I must go to the shrine!

423
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,750
Why? They gave you a job
to mop the floor?

424
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:46,917
I do have a job...

425
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,458
and I will not leave Mohenjo Daro
without seeing Chaani.

426
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,208
The Unicorn!

427
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,542
Yes... it is Mother Sindhu's vehicle.

428
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:49,833
She travels on it and is able to look
over and protect all of Sindhu Land.

429
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,417
Everyone knows of the Unicorn today...

430
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:57,125
but there is no one living
who has ever seen it.

431
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,250
This animal appeared in my dream...

432
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:06,917
standing on a river bank...
as if... waiting for me!

433
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:14,917
O Priest... what does it mean?
This Unicorn...

434
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,083
How did this seal come
into your possession?

435
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:20,250
My Uncle gave it to me...
for my protection.

436
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:22,833
Your Uncle?

437
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,583
- What is his name?
- Durjan.

438
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,250
And... your father? Where is he?

439
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,958
Many monsoons ago...

440
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:36,875
both my parents died
because of the plague.

441
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,875
Srujan was his name.

442
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,125
Place that over there.

443
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,542
Move aside!

444
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:37,667
Make Way!

445
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,667
It looks like something bad
has happened again!

446
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:14,458
Chief of Farmers and his supporters.

447
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:19,250
Who has killed him?

448
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:21,792
Maham!

449
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,250
Why?

450
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,125
He was a criminal!

451
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:30,542
They were all criminals!

452
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:38,500
All criminals!

453
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,250
What crime did they commit?

454
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:46,208
This Lakkho... he spoke the truth!
That was his crime!

455
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:52,208
That Sambhi... he asked for justice!
That was his crime!

456
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:59,833
Even I spoke for Mohenjo Daro
but Maham took all that was mine!

457
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:06,417
Now no more protests!

458
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,833
Why are the remains
left here like this, Lothar?

459
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,208
Why were they not given
their final rites?

460
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:16,833
We are not allowed...
to burn or to bury!

461
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:21,792
And whoever tried,
met the same fate!

462
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:33,125
Humans attacking animals
for survival, this I have seen...

463
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:35,667
I too have killed a crocodile
with my own hands!

464
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:39,000
But humans killing humans...

465
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,292
this I have never seen
nor heard of, Lothar!

466
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,875
And to be witness
and yet remain silent...

467
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,375
this I cannot do!

468
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:55,458
You are a guard, Lothar!

469
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,792
How can you watch this injustice
and do nothing about it?!

470
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,875
It is not so simple, Sarman!

471
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,875
I have some connection
with this city, Hojo!

472
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,958
Or else, why would the Unicorn
appear in my dreams?

473
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,292
Why did Uncle Durjan
have that seal...

474
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,458
which only those from
the Upper City have?

475
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,792
Why does this city
look so familiar to me?

476
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:30,292
Feel like my own?

477
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,917
Until I find the answers
to these questions...

478
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:39,958
I will not leave!

479
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,250
Hear! Hear!

480
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:55,875
Listen to the new tax laws!

481
00:54:56,667 --> 00:55:01,792
All of Mohenjo Daro is aware that
the Sindhu changing course...

482
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,542
has caused a lot of problems
in the Lower City.

483
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:08,667
And for that reason,
Senate Chief Maham has sanctioned...

484
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,292
an increase in taxes
for the people of Mohenjo Daro!

485
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:14,583
How can I give more tax?

486
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:17,292
Do I feed my children
from the little I have left...

487
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:19,917
or place it
in the feet of this monster.

488
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,167
I don't want Maham's help...
I cannot tolerate it any more.

489
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:25,292
But there is no other way...

490
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:28,583
if you don't obey Maham's command,
you will be killed!

491
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:35,250
Listen up... messenger of Maham!

492
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,750
Tell your Chief Maham...

493
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,792
that the people of Mohenjo Daro
will not pay more tax.

494
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,917
Who are you, you lunatic?

495
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:45,750
Go tell Maham...

496
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,833
the people of Mohenjo Daro
will not obey his command.

497
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,833
Foolish man!

498
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:55,292
The consequence
of going against Maham... is death!

499
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,208
But to accept an increase in tax
is also death!

500
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,833
The death of my children!

501
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,208
The death of my family!

502
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:10,000
I rather die at the hands of Maham
than see my children die of hunger.

503
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,208
Who all agree with me?

504
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,833
- Yes! He is right!
- I agree with him!

505
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,458
I do not want to pay
the additional tax!

506
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:18,917
We will not pay!

507
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,833
I have never seen
that man before.

508
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:48,917
This has not happened
in twenty monsoons!

509
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,458
Where did this audacity come from?

510
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:56,458
Kulka, find out...
who he is!

511
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:57,625
Right away.

512
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:21,875
The wind has stopped to listen,
even the fish are staring at you...

513
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,833
say something, Chaani!

514
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,875
Anymore silence and the Sindhu river
will shy away from the city!

515
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:31,292
How can I describe something
that I have never felt before, Junu?

516
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:35,958
It feels like rain drops
passing through the sun rays...

517
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:38,250
rendering the sky with colors.

518
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,708
This is all that Amri boys fault.

519
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,125
He may have saved your life
but he took your heart instead!

520
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:49,125
Boy?
Which boy?

521
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:52,458
The same boy
you've been daydreaming about!

522
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,750
Don't even think about him, Chaani!

523
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,500
What if you fall in love?

524
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,958
Your father gave his word
in Mother Sindhu's presence...

525
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,875
which cannot be broken!

526
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,667
I am aware...

527
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:08,708
but it's no longer
in my control, Junu!

528
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,792
But when did all this happen?

529
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:13,458
Tell me something, Junu.

530
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,625
Till now I have been thought
of as everyone's protector!

531
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:19,708
But who has ever protected me?

532
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,833
When he controlled those animals...

533
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,417
he also took control of my heart!

534
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:34,292
My breaths grew deeper
and I just stood there staring.

535
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,875
I feel I've got wings, Junu...

536
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,000
I've started to fly!

537
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,917
Everything seems so different...

538
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,292
I do not know what to make of this!

539
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:51,375
No Chaani!
This can never be!

540
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,958
This love story has to stop!

541
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:57,750
- Or else the Sindhu will...
- Let the Sindhu flow away!

542
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,833
Junu, I must meet him!
Right now!

543
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,667
But where will I find him?

544
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,458
I don't even know
where to look for him!

545
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,375
If he is still in the Lower City...

546
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:18,417
he must be waiting
for the cattle herders of Dholavira.

547
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:22,625
We could find him
in the cattle bazaar tomorrow.

548
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,833
So... let's go to the cattle bazaar!

549
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,958
Chaani, you should not be here
looking like this.

550
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:49,833
I'm worried! If someone recognises you,
we'll be in big trouble.

551
00:59:53,042 --> 00:59:53,917
Let us see!

552
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:06,125
No one recognises me...
or is even looking at me!

553
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:09,875
Do not be worried, Junu!
Now let's go find him.

554
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:13,333
It would be best
if he does not recognise you either!

555
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:15,458
Let's go.

556
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,792
Let's take this pair, Sarman.
That pair is too short tempered.

557
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,292
Hojo, she is smiling!

558
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:37,625
Smiling?

559
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:41,042
Is she smiling?

560
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:50,583
You have begun to take a liking
to every girl in this city.

561
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,875
Will you keep staring
or will you say something too?

562
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:09,000
Sarman, the goats are done
and that pair of bulls-

563
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,500
Chaani, happy to see him?

564
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:23,500
You're in the middle of the market,
not in private... anything can...

565
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,792
It's a clay bird... I made it.

566
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:52,208
You did not wear your headdress today,
but I instantly recognised you.

567
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:55,708
I wanted to see you.

568
01:01:57,792 --> 01:01:59,250
You wanted to see me?

569
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:04,542
Without your headdress,
you look even more beautiful!

570
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:11,083
You know something?

571
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,833
Everything feels so different
without my headdress.

572
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,792
No one recognises me!

573
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:19,000
No one is bowing before me!

574
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:23,083
I do not have to bless anyone
or save anyone!

575
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,292
I can do whatever I like!

576
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:30,625
And do you know
why this is happening?

577
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,042
Why?

578
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,833
Because of you!

579
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:37,833
- Because of me?
- Yes.

580
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:42,625
If I had not met you,
I would not have found myself!

581
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,250
Will you come see the city with me?

582
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,000
Me?

583
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:57,917
Yes... let's go...
come on!

584
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:55,500
<i>This rustling breeze</i>

585
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,708
<i>Rushing away in all the quarters</i>

586
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:01,708
<i>My heart flees alike</i>

587
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:04,667
<i>This breeze</i>

588
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:11,917
<i>Rustling... liberty it encounters!</i>

589
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:19,917
<i>O heart, take wings, rustle with glee,
town after town, in all quarters let me flee</i>

590
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:42,000
<i>My heart blooming with laughter</i>

591
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:48,958
<i>My body in it's tow bursting after</i>

592
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:57,458
<i>All my dreams with colours
amply mullered</i>

593
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:06,958
<i>Prisms, making everything
with love coloured</i>

594
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,708
<i>If the spring comes forth, so be it</i>

595
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:17,042
<i>If the after-night a love-Iorn
yawn yields, so be it</i>

596
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:20,917
<i>Let's hear what the breeze's
apt to impart</i>

597
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,417
<i>You're the seven-coloured
rainbow of my heart!</i>

598
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:33,667
<i>This rustling breeze
rushing away in all the quarters</i>

599
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:37,667
<i>My heart flees alike</i>

600
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:40,167
<i>This breeze</i>

601
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:47,958
<i>Rustling... liberty it encounters!</i>

602
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:57,417
<i>O heart, take wings, rustle with glee,
town after town, in all quarters let me flee</i>

603
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:34,875
<i>Methinks you're as yet unaware</i>

604
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:42,750
<i>That a world-wide measure,
full to the brim with water</i>

605
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:50,917
<i>No less love than that,
does my heart harbour</i>

606
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,750
<i>It's just you- reposed in my life,
through and through!</i>

607
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:02,542
<i>Your speech fills and thrills my heart</i>

608
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:06,750
<i>Your conversation gives
my dreams a start</i>

609
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:10,750
<i>When I see you,
sure does my heart beat faster</i>

610
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:14,958
<i>And I court a sweet disaster!</i>

611
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:25,625
<i>This rustling breeze
rushing away in all the quarters</i>

612
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:29,750
<i>My heart flees alike</i>

613
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:32,875
<i>This breeze</i>

614
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,958
<i>Rustling... liberty it encounters!</i>

615
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:45,458
<i>O heart, take wings, rustle with glee,
town after town, in all quarters let me flee</i>

616
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,833
Kulka has seen you with him!
He's coming right this way!

617
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,542
Kulka... who is that?

618
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:03,375
He is Maham's most loyal servant!
Maham will know we were here together.

619
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:05,125
$0?

620
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:07,958
Come on Chaani!
There is no time to talk!

621
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,750
Kulka has seen him as well.
He is also in danger, Junu!

622
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:19,417
Come with me...

623
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:20,625
Come on.

624
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:42,292
Make this the official trade seal
in all of Sindhu Land!

625
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:51,833
Who is this rebel?

626
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:55,833
Who has the audacity
to disobey my command?

627
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:58,083
I could not find him yet,
Senate Chief...

628
01:11:58,167 --> 01:12:00,083
but I have news about the Chosen One!

629
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:03,458
I just saw her with some man.

630
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:07,750
Scholar...

631
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:11,833
I want you to decide the day
for Chaani and Moonja's union.

632
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,958
Chaani cannot be wed until
after the Moon Bath, Senate Chief.

633
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:25,708
They are clean now!

634
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:28,458
Where were you?

635
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:32,792
I had gone to look for Chaani.
She is not in the Shrine!

636
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,250
You won't find her there today.

637
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:37,583
Tonight, there is a Moon Ritual
at the Great Bath.

638
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:41,583
Until the ritual is over,
Chaani cannot return to the Shrine.

639
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,000
Moon Ritual?

640
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:45,583
Yes... it's the lover's-alliance night.

641
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:51,542
Any boy and girl, who confess their love
under the full moon tonight...

642
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:54,167
then their Union is sealed.

643
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:58,167
Really?
Then I have to meet Chaani tonight!

644
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:02,125
You cannot go there, Sarman!
What if Moonja recognises you?

645
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:03,625
Lothar is right!

646
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:05,458
But I will still go!

647
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:07,917
Sarman, have you lost your mind?!

648
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:10,583
My mind, my sleep,
I have lost everything, Hojo!

649
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,458
I have to tell her tonight,
that she is my beloved!

650
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:04,250
What has lshme-Dagan
brought for us from Sumer?

651
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,042
(Ancient Sumer language)

652
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:14,333
Moonja, strike this stone dagger!

653
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:15,917
On this?

654
01:15:23,542 --> 01:15:25,083
Amazing!

655
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,792
It is a sword made of Copper!

656
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:33,292
- Is the Gold ready, Maham?
- Only a few more suns, lshme-Dagan.

657
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,875
Once the digging in
the riverbed is complete...

658
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:39,667
then you will receive
the decided amount of Gold.

659
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:43,875
My ships are waiting at Dholavira
with your goods, Maham!

660
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,167
How many more suns must we wait?

661
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,625
I have been waiting for
this for 20 monsoons, lshme-Dagan!

662
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:54,167
Believe me,
my need for these weapons is...

663
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57,708
far greater than
your need for the Gold!

664
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,583
I am afraid you will have to wait...

665
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,458
for this!

666
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:18,000
Right! I thank you.

667
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:20,917
There is a ritual in honor of
Mother Sindhu in the Great Bath.

668
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:24,875
You must not have seen
anything like this in Sumer.

669
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,375
Tonight on the occasion
of the full moon...

670
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:37,833
young men and women
will confess to their beloveds.

671
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,250
And then, the Chosen One, Chaani...

672
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:43,917
will immerse the figurine
of the Deity in the water.

673
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,917
By this ritual, the companions
and the future of the city...

674
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,000
will be blessed by Mother Sindhu.

675
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,875
<i>O Mother Sindhu</i>

676
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:19,042
<i>Flow as you've ever flown</i>

677
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:22,958
<i>When we're forlorn</i>

678
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:25,542
<i>Woebegone</i>

679
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:28,125
<i>And to thee alone share</i>

680
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:32,250
<i>Do lend an ear... hear!</i>

681
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:58,333
<i>O listen</i>

682
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:01,458
<i>Listen to this call, ye too</i>

683
01:19:01,542 --> 01:19:03,000
<i>Do listen!</i>

684
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:08,958
<i>In the hamlet of thy heart beats
the strange dum-dum of the drum</i>

685
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:16,333
<i>For thee live I, and thee for me,
yes together let us live</i>

686
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:26,458
<i>Sweetheart, my body, my mind, my riches
and life as well, for you alone do I nourish</i>

687
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:34,917
<i>My earth and my firmament
for thee I cherish</i>

688
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:45,125
<i>You are my whole wide world</i>

689
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:50,917
<i>My self and all my love
is for you alone furled</i>

690
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:56,958
<i>You are as though
the world's colour and glow</i>

691
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,958
<i>The spring
and my season's everything</i>

692
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:03,500
<i>You're the one,
you're the one!</i>

693
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:09,500
<i>Through the sky well high flows
this silken moonlight</i>

694
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:14,583
<i>And upon the earth your flame bright</i>

695
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:21,083
<i>Some desire inordinate
has dissolved in the eyes passionate</i>

696
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:28,917
<i>There's none like thee</i>

697
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,875
<i>You are
my whole wide world</i>

698
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:39,875
<i>My self and all my love
is for you alone furled</i>

699
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
<i>Walking along, some pathway
suddenly meets a turn blind</i>

700
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:27,958
<i>In a single moment one walks
on lea ving everything behind</i>

701
01:21:34,292 --> 01:21:39,500
<i>My star is alit, my heart roaming
around like a nomad</i>

702
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:45,250
<i>Now that my heart has heard
the love-laden melody, it spins</i>

703
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:50,917
<i>Close but silent,
why so tight-Iipped are you?</i>

704
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:56,875
<i>Let me at least ask,
who are you?</i>

705
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:02,792
<i>Let the eyes do the talking,
struck dumb I am</i>

706
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:09,250
<i>Hear with eyes,
I'm telling you who I am</i>

707
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:16,250
<i>You are my whole wide world</i>

708
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:19,167
<i>My self and all my love</i>

709
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:22,667
<i>Is for you alone furled</i>

710
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:28,000
<i>You are my whole wide world</i>

711
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,042
<i>My self and all my love</i>

712
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:34,417
<i>Is for you alone furled</i>

713
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:53,292
Sarman!
What are you doing here?!

714
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:54,583
Why have you come here?

715
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:55,833
Chaani...

716
01:23:57,083 --> 01:24:01,333
I will not leave before the questions
that trouble my heart, are answered.

717
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:04,042
What questions?

718
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,000
When I left Amri...

719
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,875
I did not know
where my journey would take me.

720
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:14,958
But I know now
that with every step...

721
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:17,417
I was coming closer to you!

722
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,875
You are my beloved, Chaani...

723
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,958
do you also feel the same?

724
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:27,417
Yes.

725
01:24:30,417 --> 01:24:31,917
Chaani?

726
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:35,417
Chaani?

727
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,625
I am changing.

728
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:39,042
Right.

729
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:44,083
- I wanted to ask you a few questions.
- I am listening.

730
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:49,167
Why were you roaming the bazaar
without your headdress?

731
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,375
Who was with you?

732
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:59,333
What is the meaning
of your questions, Moonja?

733
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:03,083
I was with... Junu.

734
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,208
Your clothes are lying out here!

735
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:35,042
Your clothes are lying out here!!

736
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:43,833
I know and I also know
the boundaries of modesty.

737
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:48,000
Leave,
so that I may come out.

738
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:50,375
Right.

739
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:03,083
How dare you?

740
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:06,042
How can you take advantage
of someone's innocence?!

741
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:09,125
Advantage?
I took advantage of you?

742
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:11,833
Were you not hinting at me
with your doe like eyes.

743
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:15,500
- What else could I do?
- I was looking at you with anger!

744
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:20,708
I made a mistake,
your eyes are very mischievous...

745
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:23,292
they want one thing,
but they say something else.

746
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,250
Do you now understand...

747
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,667
how it feels when someone
takes advantage of you?

748
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:33,042
No I did not.

749
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:35,833
Show me again.

750
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:59,625
No!
This is not right!

751
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:02,792
I cannot do this!

752
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:04,708
Why?

753
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:08,625
- This is inappropriate!
- What is inappropriate, Chaani?

754
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:14,375
We cannot be together, Sarman!
It has already been decided.

755
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:16,583
What is decided, Chaani?

756
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:23,375
That“
I will be Moonja's companion!

757
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:25,625
Moonja's companion?

758
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,417
When was this decided?

759
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:32,167
When I was born.

760
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,042
When a mother dies
during child birth...

761
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,417
the new born is considered
an omen in Mohenjo Daro.

762
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:43,208
People walked away
without even looking at my face.

763
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:47,042
Then, a Scholar from
the Senate arrived.

764
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:52,208
This child is the blessing
of Mother Sindhu...

765
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,292
she is the Chosen One
of Mohenjo Daro.

766
01:27:55,833 --> 01:28:00,500
The future of this great city
rests on her decisions.

767
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:02,625
There will come a time...

768
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:05,625
when your daughter
will usher in a New Order.

769
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:10,125
When Maham found out that
I was blessed by Mother Sindhu...

770
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:13,375
he and his companion arrived
at our doorstep with fanfare!

771
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:17,292
And in front of
all the Upper City elders...

772
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,375
he proclaimed that I will be
Moonja's companion when I came of age.

773
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:24,542
This Union is decided, Sarman...
no one can change it!

774
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:36,208
There is no situation
that cannot be changed!

775
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,208
Go!

776
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,750
The other way.

777
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,750
This way!

778
01:28:56,042 --> 01:28:57,208
Go!

779
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,667
What?

780
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:29,958
What...?
And did you also...?

781
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:35,333
Chaani... this is not right!
What if Moonja finds out?!

782
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:36,875
Senate Chief Maham!

783
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:47,292
I welcome you to the Shrine,
Senate Chief.

784
01:29:52,417 --> 01:29:55,125
The Moon Ritual is now over, Priest.

785
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,500
The time has come that
you fulfill your promise!

786
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:13,500
Maham, only a few more monsoons,
Chaani is still very innocent.

787
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,917
She's not so innocent.

788
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:19,667
The rumors of her new
'company' are being heard.

789
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:23,125
Now, to wait for even
one more sunrise is too long!

790
01:30:24,333 --> 01:30:28,750
Maham, just a little while longer,
I will speak to Chaani.

791
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:32,750
This is an order,
not a request Priest!

792
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:39,042
And you are aware of
the consequences, if you disobey me.

793
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:43,542
Were you not Chaani's father...

794
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,000
Make preparations!

795
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:53,417
Chaani's Union with Moonja
will take place after two suns.

796
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:31,417
Looking at you,
brings back memories of my Union.

797
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:36,083
Without you saying a word...

798
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,292
I know that
you don't like Moonja.

799
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:42,500
True, I am Maham's companion...

800
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:49,208
but my presence makes
no difference to anybody.

801
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,500
But I know everything, Chaani.

802
01:31:53,833 --> 01:32:00,292
My son is a little rough
like his father...

803
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,167
but I am very happy...

804
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:09,125
because if you are with him,
then my son might change.

805
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:11,750
Once you become his companion.

806
01:32:13,292 --> 01:32:15,875
Junu, you stay here with Chaani.

807
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:20,292
When it is time for the ceremony,
I will come to take her!

808
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:24,833
Sarman!

809
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:31,667
People of Mohenjo Daro...

810
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:37,000
Moonja and Chaani's Union
will usher in a New Order...

811
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,167
and that is why
it is my decision...

812
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:44,792
that Moonja will be
the next Senate Chief.

813
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:48,625
And the New Order
of Mohenjo Daro will begin.

814
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:06,000
What are you doing here?

815
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:07,750
Why are you agreeing
to be Moonja's companion...

816
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:09,875
when you do not love him!

817
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:12,875
I don't have the freedom
to choose my companion, Sarman!

818
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:15,500
I am only fulfilling father's promise.

819
01:33:15,792 --> 01:33:18,750
No Chaani!
Not your father's promise.

820
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:21,000
You are following
Maham's command.

821
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:26,208
Companions come together
because of a Union of the hearts...

822
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:29,833
and your heart
has not chosen Moonja!

823
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:31,875
You do not understand, Sarman.

824
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:35,625
What if... because of
my Union with Moonja...

825
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:40,417
I am able to rid Mohenjo Daro
of it's troubles.

826
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:44,167
What if... this Union leads us
to the New Order...

827
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,167
which everyone
has been dreaming of?

828
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:48,958
Chaani, but...

829
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,375
do you really believe
that because of this...

830
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:54,208
you will be able to save this city?

831
01:33:54,917 --> 01:33:56,875
He is only using you!

832
01:33:57,583 --> 01:34:00,750
And how can a Union that
makes Maham more powerful...

833
01:34:01,167 --> 01:34:03,208
usher in a New Order?

834
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:09,833
Do not be afraid of Maham, Chaani!
I am with you!

835
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,500
Chaani... hurry up!
We are running out of time!

836
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:19,417
Maham is not used to hearing a no!

837
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,500
And till today whoever has
opposed him, has been silenced.

838
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:25,167
If I break this Union today...

839
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,708
then father and all of Mohenjo Daro
will have to suffer the consequences.

840
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:33,000
You will have to become the
Chosen One now, on whose decisions...

841
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,833
the people of Mohenjo Daro
place their faith!

842
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:45,667
- Sarman, you go!
- Listen to your heart, Chaani...

843
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,625
the way I listened to mine
and came here.

844
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:51,875
Be fearless... whatever choice you make,
It will be right!

845
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:54,875
Moonja!

846
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:04,167
- Moonja!
- Silence!

847
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,875
Junu, tell father immediately!

848
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:21,792
It is the Chosen One's Union!
How can we not be allowed to enter!

849
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:24,208
You cannot do this!
Let us inside!

850
01:36:41,583 --> 01:36:42,958
Get him, Sarman!

851
01:36:50,833 --> 01:36:52,500
Stop Moonja!

852
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:55,750
Stop!

853
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,833
Who are you?

854
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:10,292
How dare you raise your hand on the
future Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro?

855
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:15,750
And to top that, this scoundrel has been
eyeing the girl who is betrothed to me.

856
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:25,583
So you are the one who instigated
the people to refuse the tax.

857
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:31,000
For these crimes, this man will be
sentenced this instant...

858
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:32,417
the death penalty!

859
01:37:42,542 --> 01:37:43,875
Forgive him!

860
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:50,083
He is not from around here.
He has done this out of ignorance.

861
01:37:50,292 --> 01:37:52,875
He is not familiar with the rules
and norms of Mohenjo Daro!

862
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:56,250
Do not carry the burden of
his death on your head, Maham!

863
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,417
No!
He should not be forgiven.

864
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:03,208
He should be put on a staff...
or I should be allowed to behead him!

865
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:04,667
No, Moonja!

866
01:38:06,042 --> 01:38:09,375
Play with fire but
do not burn yourself!

867
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:17,417
They have seen my cruelty,
now they will see my kindness.

868
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:25,125
The Priest has pleaded forgiveness
for this man.

869
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:28,833
I will respect his wishes!

870
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:31,833
My decision is...

871
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:38,292
that this man should be given
a chance to save himself!

872
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:42,000
He will have to pass a test!

873
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:44,167
What kind of test, Senate Chief?

874
01:38:44,417 --> 01:38:49,792
The test that is considered to be the
epitome ofjustice in Mohenjo Daro!

875
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,792
The test of Bakar Zokaar!

876
01:38:54,458 --> 01:38:55,792
Bakar Zokaar?

877
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:58,208
Whatever your test is,
laccepfl

878
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,458
But I have one wish.

879
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:06,292
A wish?
You mean death wish!

880
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:08,458
So consider it a death wish then!

881
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,667
What is that?

882
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:13,833
If I win...

883
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,458
Chaani will be set free
from this Union.

884
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
She will not be
Moonja's companion!

885
01:39:31,917 --> 01:39:33,750
Iaccepu

886
01:39:37,917 --> 01:39:40,500
Till Mother Sindhu
does not do justice...

887
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:43,500
there will be no celebration
in Mohenjo Daro!

888
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:49,458
Bring him!

889
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:19,625
Stop the test of Bakar Zokaar, Moonja.

890
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:22,333
I will willingly be your companion!

891
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:26,125
You are already my companion,
so what kind of deal is this?

892
01:40:26,375 --> 01:40:29,667
Let him go, Moonja!
He's just a commoner.

893
01:40:29,792 --> 01:40:31,042
Commoner?

894
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:34,917
This 'commoner' humiliated me!

895
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:41,750
He will have to die an animal's death
in the presence of the entire city.

896
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:46,000
I want to see the people
hear his screams!

897
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:51,583
He will have to go through
the test of Bakar Zokaar!

898
01:40:58,333 --> 01:40:59,958
Let's go, Chaani!

899
01:41:09,208 --> 01:41:10,792
Kunnu, Dheeru...

900
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,375
call the healer!

901
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:21,625
It is not he who has commited the crime,
it is me, Mother!

902
01:41:22,667 --> 01:41:25,417
If you have not given me the right
to fall in love...

903
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:28,583
then why did you make me meet him?

904
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,750
Why did you make me
fall in love with him?

905
01:41:34,208 --> 01:41:43,542
If the punishment for our Union is death,
then take my life... instead of his!

906
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:47,167
Take my life!

907
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:27,667
What happened was not good.

908
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:33,000
Sarman, I am here
to tell you something...

909
01:42:34,292 --> 01:42:35,875
that is important
for you to know.

910
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:38,458
And what is that?

911
01:42:39,083 --> 01:42:42,583
The Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro,
before Maham...

912
01:42:44,042 --> 01:42:45,458
his name was...

913
01:42:47,042 --> 01:42:48,125
u.

914
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:50,500
Your father!

915
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:55,083
My father...?

916
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:58,458
Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro...?

917
01:42:59,917 --> 01:43:02,583
How can this be?
We are from Amri.

918
01:43:02,667 --> 01:43:07,333
Your Uncle Durjan lied to you
about your father's death.

919
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:10,417
But what choice did he have?

920
01:43:11,167 --> 01:43:13,542
He did not have the courage
to tell you the truth.

921
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,708
Truth about?

922
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:19,292
Srujan was the greatest Senate Chief
Mohenjo Daro had ever seen.

923
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:21,583
Maham was the Chief of Merchants then.

924
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,333
He struck a deal
with the Sumerians in secret...

925
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,625
and then made
a proposition in the Senate.

926
01:43:30,167 --> 01:43:33,208
As the Sindhu River
comes down the mountain...

927
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:38,583
in this region here,
there are deposits of a yellow metal...

928
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:42,083
that shines like
the rays of the sun.

929
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:43,875
Gold!

930
01:43:45,292 --> 01:43:47,917
You will not find this
anywhere else.

931
01:43:48,417 --> 01:43:54,375
My proposition is to build a dam
and halt the waters of the Sindhu...

932
01:43:54,917 --> 01:43:58,083
and then mine the Gold
buried in the riverbed.

933
01:43:58,708 --> 01:43:59,792
A dam?

934
01:44:00,917 --> 01:44:02,667
But then how will the river flow?

935
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,250
It will flow Jakhiro...

936
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:09,625
and for that we will dig
a new path for the river...

937
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:12,542
which will rejoin here.

938
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:16,708
We should not do this.

939
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:21,583
Sindhu River is akin to our Mother!

940
01:44:22,208 --> 01:44:26,167
To halt her waters will be
against the Sindhu Order!

941
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
If the dam forces the river
to turn away from the city...

942
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:33,792
where will we get water
for drinking and farming.

943
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:36,917
Sindhu is no small stream...
it is a huge river.

944
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,208
An ordinary dam will not be
able to change its course.

945
01:44:40,667 --> 01:44:45,000
But because of the Gold, all the
foreigners who go to Harappa...

946
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:47,208
will be attracted to Mohenjo Daro.

947
01:44:47,458 --> 01:44:52,208
Trade will grow,
the people will benefit...

948
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:56,667
there will be contentment!
Wide roads, better houses...

949
01:44:56,792 --> 01:45:00,208
Mohenjo Daro will become
much stronger than Harappa.

950
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:01,833
Maham!

951
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,958
Do not mislead the Senate by
building dreams out of thin air!

952
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:09,375
Those who agree with me
raise your palms...

953
01:45:09,917 --> 01:45:12,500
those who agree with Maham,
show your fists!

954
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:16,042
I Jakhiro, am with Srujan!

955
01:45:16,542 --> 01:45:18,667
I am with Maham!

956
01:45:20,583 --> 01:45:22,208
I am with Srujan!

957
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:29,250
I am with my brother,
Senate Chief Srujan!

958
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:34,417
7 are with me, 7 are with Maham.

959
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:38,208
Priest, now you speak!

960
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:57,958
And in fear of Maham, I did exactly
what I should not have done...

961
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:06,083
- and Maham won the vote.
- The dam will be built on Sindhu River!

962
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:10,500
And then?

963
01:46:11,042 --> 01:46:13,292
The dam's construction
on the Sindhu began.

964
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:17,208
The people worked
tirelessly for their city...

965
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:21,750
unaware of Maham's treachery.

966
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:26,208
At times with cunning
and at times by force...

967
01:46:26,292 --> 01:46:29,500
Maham turned everyone
against Srujan!

968
01:46:30,375 --> 01:46:32,833
Those who did not
fall for the greed of Gold...

969
01:46:32,917 --> 01:46:35,792
were silenced by
the fear of his bandits.

970
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:40,042
Summoned from the Kirthar mountains...

971
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:44,167
those bandits became protectors,
not only of Maham, but also of the city!

972
01:46:49,542 --> 01:46:54,667
The river took a new course
and the hidden Gold was revealed.

973
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:03,333
But your father was still
concerned about the dam.

974
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:05,958
Maham has betrayed us all!

975
01:47:07,167 --> 01:47:10,542
The dam is so big that the river
will be forced to turn away!

976
01:47:12,167 --> 01:47:13,583
We need to stop this!

977
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:19,125
Stop work!

978
01:47:19,542 --> 01:47:22,417
If this dam is made, then Mother Sindhu
will turn away from the city.

979
01:47:24,125 --> 01:47:25,667
Keep working!

980
01:47:26,417 --> 01:47:28,000
Srujan...

981
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:46,458
Maham falsely accused Srujan...

982
01:47:46,833 --> 01:47:50,208
and by some treachery,
Maham hid Gold in Srujan's house...

983
01:47:50,667 --> 01:47:52,208
and then had him arrested.

984
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:58,125
Citizens! This traitor is not fit
to be called Senate Chief!

985
01:47:58,542 --> 01:48:01,792
He is a criminal!
A criminal of the entire city!

986
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:04,250
He should be given the death penalty!

987
01:48:05,458 --> 01:48:08,125
Death penalty!

988
01:48:11,333 --> 01:48:15,083
This is not true!
Do not let him mislead you!

989
01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:18,458
He is a fraud!
He will destroy Mohenjo Daro!

990
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:23,292
Priest! Say something!
You know me since we were boys...

991
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:25,542
I would never wish harm
upon Mohenjo Daro!

992
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:26,958
Speak!

993
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:29,000
And what did you say?

994
01:48:29,292 --> 01:48:31,625
I just stood there,
staring at his face...

995
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:36,958
I was helpless,
Chaani had no one but me.

996
01:48:38,542 --> 01:48:40,917
And Uncle Durjan?

997
01:48:44,333 --> 01:48:47,167
He too knows the truth!
Durjan tell them!

998
01:48:51,417 --> 01:48:52,833
Tell everyone, Durjan.

999
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,750
Why are you quiet, Durjan?
Tell people the truth!

1000
01:49:13,042 --> 01:49:14,375
I don't know anything!

1001
01:49:18,542 --> 01:49:20,917
Death penalty!

1002
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:45,375
And Mother...

1003
01:49:48,208 --> 01:49:53,208
- what happened to her?
- The trauma was too much for her...

1004
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:56,917
she could not bear
the shock and died.

1005
01:50:07,208 --> 01:50:08,833
And then?

1006
01:50:09,542 --> 01:50:12,208
Maham took the Senate
under his control...

1007
01:50:13,042 --> 01:50:15,417
and proclaimed himself
as the Senate Chief.

1008
01:50:16,417 --> 01:50:20,167
Then he began stripping
the Sindhu Order of its principles...

1009
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:23,042
and violated its rules of
conduct and trade.

1010
01:50:23,208 --> 01:50:26,417
And what Srujan had said,
came true.

1011
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:30,125
Because of the dam,
the Sindhu River began to turn away...

1012
01:50:30,208 --> 01:50:32,750
and many villages ran dry.

1013
01:50:33,333 --> 01:50:37,167
The villagers started to migrate
to Mohenjo Daro.

1014
01:50:37,583 --> 01:50:40,875
The city grew,
the number of people increased...

1015
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:44,833
and under their pressure,
Mohenjo Daro began to crumble.

1016
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,917
The Maham Order had begun.

1017
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,958
Whoever supported him
was given Gold...

1018
01:50:51,042 --> 01:50:53,042
the rest were given death.

1019
01:50:55,625 --> 01:50:59,833
Srujan did not commit any crime.
We did!

1020
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:02,208
I did!

1021
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:06,458
The cause of Srujan's death
was not Maham...

1022
01:51:08,375 --> 01:51:09,417
it was me!

1023
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:15,250
I cannot even ask for your
forgiveness, Sarman!

1024
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:18,583
How can I?

1025
01:51:25,208 --> 01:51:30,375
That is why everything
seemed so familiar.

1026
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:35,750
I was born here.

1027
01:51:37,833 --> 01:51:39,917
I spent my childhood here.

1028
01:51:42,958 --> 01:51:45,333
My father gave his life
for this city...

1029
01:51:47,917 --> 01:51:49,750
and this city gave him death.

1030
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:54,667
It was imperative that I tell you
the truth about your past, Sarman!

1031
01:51:56,375 --> 01:52:01,083
May Mother Sindhu protect you
and give you strength!

1032
01:52:02,458 --> 01:52:05,500
Tomorrow, when you face
Bakar Zokaar in the arena...

1033
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:07,833
remember that the
bigger enemy is Maham...

1034
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:12,042
who spilled the blood of your family
and shook the foundation of this city.

1035
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:16,458
Only you can save your father's city
from destruction, Sarman!

1036
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,792
Only you can stop Maham!

1037
01:52:25,333 --> 01:52:27,083
This is my city.

1038
01:52:28,792 --> 01:52:30,583
Mohenjo Daro!

1039
01:53:03,667 --> 01:53:04,458
Duflan!

1040
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:09,542
Here are your goods!

1041
01:53:11,958 --> 01:53:15,583
Sarman stayed back in wait of
the cattle herders of Dholvaira.

1042
01:53:16,042 --> 01:53:18,625
He will return only
when he has the bulls and goats.

1043
01:53:19,917 --> 01:53:22,083
Why did you leave him behind, Phulji?

1044
01:53:23,417 --> 01:53:25,417
Just as you were unable
to stop him from leaving...

1045
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,500
I was unable to
stop him from staying.

1046
01:53:28,333 --> 01:53:30,542
I'll take your leave.

1047
01:53:35,792 --> 01:53:37,542
I'm getting worried...

1048
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:41,083
do you think he found out?

1049
01:53:43,542 --> 01:53:45,125
I do not know...

1050
01:54:39,375 --> 01:54:40,292
Attention!

1051
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:46,250
Today, we carry out
the most cruel sentence.

1052
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:58,500
A criminal must be punished!
He will face Bakar and Zokaar!

1053
01:54:59,708 --> 01:55:03,167
The boon of life
or the curse of death!

1054
01:55:04,292 --> 01:55:08,708
Truth will win
and falsehoods will lose!

1055
01:55:09,875 --> 01:55:12,167
Bring the prisoner!

1056
01:55:42,583 --> 01:55:43,875
Weapons!

1057
01:55:54,417 --> 01:55:55,958
He will choose the trident!

1058
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:20,500
Bring in Bakar and Zokaar!

1059
01:57:40,083 --> 01:57:45,792
Ishme-Dagan,
this is Bakar and Zokaar!

1060
01:57:46,083 --> 01:57:50,417
They are both man-eaters brought
from the mountains of Tajik.

1061
01:57:50,667 --> 01:57:55,125
They strike only to kill,
only to satiate their hunger.

1062
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:38,333
(Tribal language)

1063
01:59:39,792 --> 01:59:41,708
That means death.

1064
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:40,917
Bakar Zokaar will not survive now.

1065
02:01:37,292 --> 02:01:38,958
Zokaafl

1066
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,417
Sarman... Sarman...

1067
02:07:55,792 --> 02:07:58,000
This is the meaning
of your coming here Sarman!

1068
02:07:58,083 --> 02:08:00,667
You are the savior of Mohenjo Daro!

1069
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:03,167
And if the people
were to learn who you are...

1070
02:08:03,292 --> 02:08:04,917
they will stand by you!

1071
02:08:05,417 --> 02:08:06,917
You are the only hope, Sarman...

1072
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,250
or else the future generations
will never know...

1073
02:08:09,333 --> 02:08:12,208
<i>the truth or the goodness
of Moherfyo Dare.</i>

1074
02:08:34,875 --> 02:08:36,125
Moonja.

1075
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:39,958
You are to be the next
Senate Chief of Mohenjo Daro!

1076
02:08:41,208 --> 02:08:45,042
But I can already
sense defeat in you!

1077
02:08:46,292 --> 02:08:53,333
I will not let my son be defeated
without spilling any blood.

1078
02:08:55,667 --> 02:08:58,042
If you want to live in
a garden of flowers...

1079
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
you must first
weed out the wild plants.

1080
02:09:04,042 --> 02:09:05,250
The Priest?

1081
02:09:05,333 --> 02:09:09,583
The Priest... and Chaani!

1082
02:09:11,708 --> 02:09:13,833
We no longer have any
use for the two of them.

1083
02:09:13,917 --> 02:09:14,958
No father...

1084
02:09:15,875 --> 02:09:18,833
Chaani is not to blame,
Sarman is!

1085
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:22,208
He has misled Chaani!

1086
02:09:22,917 --> 02:09:25,250
His neck was in my hands,
only if-

1087
02:09:27,792 --> 02:09:32,375
Now the fire in my body
will only be doused by his blood!

1088
02:09:35,458 --> 02:09:37,458
Chaani is mine!

1089
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:40,917
Open your eyes, Moonja!

1090
02:09:41,083 --> 02:09:44,708
Love will make you weak, Moonja!

1091
02:09:45,417 --> 02:09:48,833
Do not focus on love,
rule instead!

1092
02:09:49,958 --> 02:09:53,792
Soon, Mohenjo Daro will be yours...

1093
02:09:54,292 --> 02:09:56,625
the entire Sindhu Land
will be yours...

1094
02:09:57,083 --> 02:10:00,250
any girl you set
your eyes on, will be yours!

1095
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:03,500
But first, make use of
these weapons, Moonja!

1096
02:10:03,833 --> 02:10:07,083
And spill the blood
of that Chosen One...

1097
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:11,042
of the Priest...
of Sarman...

1098
02:10:11,125 --> 02:10:13,875
let none of them
see the next sunrise.

1099
02:10:58,458 --> 02:10:59,708
Moonja!

1100
02:11:03,708 --> 02:11:05,000
Father!

1101
02:11:16,583 --> 02:11:17,625
Father!

1102
02:11:20,667 --> 02:11:21,917
Run!

1103
02:11:22,417 --> 02:11:23,583
Father!

1104
02:12:12,667 --> 02:12:15,500
If not to me,
then you belong to no one!

1105
02:15:30,833 --> 02:15:33,083
We must tell them
the truth, Sarman!

1106
02:15:36,167 --> 02:15:37,958
Everyone listen!

1107
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:42,583
Sarman has a very deep
connection to Mohenjo Daro.

1108
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,333
My father had learned this...

1109
02:15:45,833 --> 02:15:49,208
and that is why,
before the test of Bakar and Zokaar...

1110
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:51,500
my father told Sarman the truth.

1111
02:15:51,958 --> 02:15:56,083
- And what is that, Chaani?
- The truth is...

1112
02:15:56,708 --> 02:16:00,000
that Sarman is the son
of the Senate Chief, Srujan!

1113
02:16:02,875 --> 02:16:04,292
I knew it!

1114
02:16:04,667 --> 02:16:09,708
This youth of Amri
was born on this very land!

1115
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:16,917
Duflan?

1116
02:16:28,958 --> 02:16:33,625
And my father was confident that when
the people would learn the truth...

1117
02:16:33,958 --> 02:16:36,083
then they would come together
and stand behind Sarman!

1118
02:16:36,167 --> 02:16:39,042
Yes!

1119
02:16:43,583 --> 02:16:47,208
Maham blinded us by creating an
illusion of a great Mohenjo Daro...

1120
02:16:47,458 --> 02:16:48,958
but now,
our eyes have been opened!

1121
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:51,625
We made a mistake once...
not again!

1122
02:16:51,708 --> 02:16:54,792
O son of Srujan...
we are ready to fight!

1123
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:58,167
Show us the way...
we are with you, Sarman!

1124
02:16:58,875 --> 02:17:00,625
Right!

1125
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:07,083
First of all...

1126
02:17:08,875 --> 02:17:11,125
we must heal the wounds
that run deep.

1127
02:17:13,667 --> 02:17:16,292
All those people who gave
their lives for Mohenjo Daro...

1128
02:17:17,583 --> 02:17:19,917
we will honor their sacrifice.

1129
02:17:21,083 --> 02:17:23,000
We will give their remains
their last rites.

1130
02:17:25,625 --> 02:17:29,417
Yes, Sarman!
You are right! Let's go!

1131
02:17:39,958 --> 02:17:41,208
First, we must give him peace!

1132
02:17:41,292 --> 02:17:44,042
Senate Chief Srujan!
He had always spoken the truth!

1133
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:57,417
My father!

1134
02:18:55,167 --> 02:18:56,750
So many monsoons have passed!

1135
02:18:58,625 --> 02:19:00,792
Why did you not
tell me about my past?

1136
02:19:02,167 --> 02:19:03,625
I was afraid, Sarman.

1137
02:19:07,625 --> 02:19:09,708
I had already lost Srujan...

1138
02:19:12,208 --> 02:19:15,333
I was afraid
that I would lose you too.

1139
02:19:18,583 --> 02:19:20,542
Forgive me, Sarman.

1140
02:19:23,083 --> 02:19:24,750
I was weak.

1141
02:19:25,458 --> 02:19:29,125
I did not have your father's courage!

1142
02:19:29,917 --> 02:19:31,458
Forgive me!

1143
02:19:34,833 --> 02:19:39,292
We were always worried
about your well being...

1144
02:19:40,583 --> 02:19:43,333
back then and even now.

1145
02:19:44,375 --> 02:19:46,125
Forgive us!

1146
02:19:51,625 --> 02:19:53,500
We cannot change the past, Aunt Bima.

1147
02:19:56,458 --> 02:19:58,667
We can now only look to the future!

1148
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,792
Make preparations for
the last rites of my son!

1149
02:20:40,458 --> 02:20:42,292
According to Harappan tradition...

1150
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:44,958
we will put his body
in flowing water.

1151
02:20:45,333 --> 02:20:48,042
You and I have no
relation to Harappa!

1152
02:20:48,917 --> 02:20:50,333
We are related by birth!

1153
02:20:50,458 --> 02:20:53,208
That relation was broken
many monsoons ago!

1154
02:20:53,458 --> 02:20:55,625
Who broke this relation?

1155
02:20:56,792 --> 02:20:58,917
You betrayed them!

1156
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,667
For what do you seek revenge?!

1157
02:21:05,042 --> 02:21:07,000
And till when will
you keep seeking it?

1158
02:21:07,292 --> 02:21:10,958
These weapons will not
bring your son back!

1159
02:21:12,208 --> 02:21:15,042
This yellow metal cannot
give you your revenge!

1160
02:21:15,125 --> 02:21:16,375
Laashfl

1161
02:21:16,917 --> 02:21:20,917
The cause of every problem in
Mohenjo Daro... is your greed, Maham!

1162
02:21:21,583 --> 02:21:24,000
The death of my son is
also because of your greed!

1163
02:21:33,333 --> 02:21:35,333
Do you know who Sarman is?

1164
02:21:36,292 --> 02:21:38,375
He is Srujan's son!

1165
02:21:42,083 --> 02:21:47,083
You put his father on a staff
and he killed your son!

1166
02:21:47,292 --> 02:21:49,250
This is the justice of the Sindhu!

1167
02:21:50,875 --> 02:21:53,917
You are responsible
for the death of your son, Maham!

1168
02:21:54,375 --> 02:21:58,750
Now whatever you do, you cannot
stop your own destruction!

1169
02:22:03,167 --> 02:22:04,917
Srujan's son?

1170
02:22:06,167 --> 02:22:08,750
Sarman is Srujan's son?!

1171
02:22:13,917 --> 02:22:16,750
Many monsoons ago the Sindhu river
used to flow through here.

1172
02:22:22,958 --> 02:22:25,250
Quickly...

1173
02:22:32,208 --> 02:22:33,667
Work quickly!

1174
02:22:34,083 --> 02:22:36,042
Before the sunrise tomorrow...

1175
02:22:36,125 --> 02:22:38,375
we have to dispatch
the bullcarts to Dholavira.

1176
02:22:43,708 --> 02:22:44,833
Let's g0!

1177
02:22:44,917 --> 02:22:46,708
Work quickly!

1178
02:22:46,792 --> 02:22:49,625
Load the sacks of Gold
onto the bullcarts!

1179
02:23:51,542 --> 02:23:54,208
Sarman, despite knowing everything,
I continued to serve Maham.

1180
02:23:54,542 --> 02:23:58,167
Now I want to serve Mohenjo Daro.
Tell us, what must we do?

1181
02:23:58,833 --> 02:24:02,583
The traders from Sumer have left
with their carts full of Gold.

1182
02:24:03,542 --> 02:24:05,000
We must stop them!

1183
02:24:05,083 --> 02:24:08,500
This is our only chance
to expose Maham's betrayal.

1184
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:12,583
- Right! When do we leave?
- Now!

1185
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:21,458
Ishme-Dagan!

1186
02:24:21,542 --> 02:24:23,500
This path will lead you
straight to Dholavira.

1187
02:24:23,708 --> 02:24:24,750
I thank you.

1188
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:33,875
What is the matter?

1189
02:25:10,583 --> 02:25:13,583
- I am only a trader!
- You are a smuggler!

1190
02:25:13,667 --> 02:25:16,875
The next time you smuggle your
weapons into Sindhu Land...

1191
02:25:16,958 --> 02:25:19,000
you will have to face me!

1192
02:25:32,250 --> 02:25:33,792
Bhanu!

1193
02:25:34,917 --> 02:25:36,125
Listen carefully!

1194
02:25:36,583 --> 02:25:39,042
Go to the dam and wait there,
keep your eyes on the water.

1195
02:25:39,125 --> 02:25:40,833
If you see any signs of trouble,
come and tell me.

1196
02:25:40,917 --> 02:25:42,167
Right? Go!
- Right.

1197
02:25:48,375 --> 02:25:50,875
Senate Chief!

1198
02:25:52,583 --> 02:25:55,167
Sarman and his supporters
have taken the Gold!

1199
02:25:55,667 --> 02:25:56,625
What?!

1200
02:25:57,083 --> 02:25:59,000
They have also taken Kulka prisoner!

1201
02:25:59,875 --> 02:26:02,542
Now, they are bringing him
in front of the people!

1202
02:26:03,083 --> 02:26:04,542
How could this have happened?

1203
02:26:07,167 --> 02:26:08,958
Before the sun reaches the top...

1204
02:26:09,333 --> 02:26:12,500
Kulka and Sarman,
should not be left alive.

1205
02:26:12,583 --> 02:26:15,167
<i>'</i> Go!
_ Let's go!

1206
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:18,333
Listen!
Inform all the Chiefs...

1207
02:26:18,458 --> 02:26:21,042
the Senate will
assemble immediately.

1208
02:26:21,125 --> 02:26:25,250
Till now, Maham had you believe
that in exchange of Gold...

1209
02:26:25,792 --> 02:26:27,958
we will get goods, which we can
use in the upkeep of the city.

1210
02:26:29,375 --> 02:26:30,792
But this was not the case!

1211
02:26:32,875 --> 02:26:36,583
In exchange for this Gold, Maham was
trading this with the Sumerians.

1212
02:26:38,167 --> 02:26:39,750
Weapons of Copper!

1213
02:26:41,625 --> 02:26:43,792
And on the strength
of these weapons...

1214
02:26:44,042 --> 02:26:46,000
he was going to launch
an attack on Harappa!

1215
02:26:46,083 --> 02:26:48,208
He wants to take revenge
for his humiliation.

1216
02:26:48,292 --> 02:26:52,833
And this is the reason why Maham
had proposed to build the dam.

1217
02:26:54,375 --> 02:26:58,083
The time has come for us to raise
our palms and turn them into fists.

1218
02:26:58,167 --> 02:26:59,833
Yes!

1219
02:26:59,917 --> 02:27:01,583
Let's charge towards the Senate!

1220
02:28:13,375 --> 02:28:15,292
Everyone knows the truth
about you, Maham!

1221
02:28:17,167 --> 02:28:18,667
No one stands with you anymore!

1222
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:26,125
Your crimes end here and now.

1223
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:29,208
Who will end me?

1224
02:28:29,917 --> 02:28:31,625
Who has the courage to...

1225
02:28:37,167 --> 02:28:41,250
You have invited death, Sarman!

1226
02:28:41,917 --> 02:28:44,958
Whoever opposed me was killed!

1227
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:47,958
I put even Srujan on the staff!

1228
02:28:56,042 --> 02:28:58,917
The blood that you have spilled
the same blood runs in my veins!

1229
02:29:00,292 --> 02:29:02,208
I am your end, Maham!

1230
02:29:06,042 --> 02:29:07,250
Kill him!

1231
02:29:07,917 --> 02:29:08,833
Strike him!

1232
02:29:08,917 --> 02:29:11,917
In exchange for his head,
you will get Gold!

1233
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,167
He has nothing to give you!

1234
02:29:15,542 --> 02:29:18,542
The people have taken over everything,
your gold rig and your weapons!

1235
02:29:19,750 --> 02:29:21,458
You are alone, Maham!

1236
02:29:22,375 --> 02:29:23,917
Completely alone.

1237
02:29:27,083 --> 02:29:31,292
No!
Do not be misled by him!

1238
02:29:31,583 --> 02:29:34,542
I am still the Senate Chief
and you work for me!

1239
02:29:34,625 --> 02:29:37,875
We do not work for you, Maham,
but for gold!

1240
02:29:37,958 --> 02:29:42,292
It is clear to me that you have
nothing left to offer!

1241
02:29:44,208 --> 02:29:47,792
So now that you have gold,
you consider yourself powerful?

1242
02:29:48,125 --> 02:29:50,917
Your greed to rule is making
you do this, Sarman!

1243
02:29:51,333 --> 02:29:55,042
What then is the difference
between me and you?!

1244
02:29:59,375 --> 02:30:01,125
There is a difference, Maham!

1245
02:30:01,625 --> 02:30:03,583
You want to rule
over Mohenjo Daro...

1246
02:30:04,750 --> 02:30:06,208
and I want to serve it...

1247
02:30:07,125 --> 02:30:09,250
like my father used to do.

1248
02:30:11,833 --> 02:30:13,833
This is my city, Maham!

1249
02:30:14,292 --> 02:30:16,375
This is my father,
Srujan's city!

1250
02:30:22,708 --> 02:30:24,042
Chiefs of the Senate...

1251
02:30:24,375 --> 02:30:27,250
the ones who stand by Maham,
raise your palms...

1252
02:30:27,833 --> 02:30:30,583
but those who oppose,
show your fists!

1253
02:30:33,250 --> 02:30:35,667
The new Senate Chief of
Mohenjo Daro, will be Sarman!

1254
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:37,500
Yes!

1255
02:30:43,375 --> 02:30:44,625
No.

1256
02:30:45,708 --> 02:30:47,917
Mohenjo Daro will no longer
be ruled by a Senate Chief...

1257
02:30:48,625 --> 02:30:50,250
but by its people.

1258
02:30:50,458 --> 02:30:51,375
Take him!

1259
02:30:51,917 --> 02:30:52,750
Come on.

1260
02:31:23,542 --> 02:31:26,750
Death penalty!

1261
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:41,583
Come on, hurry up!

1262
02:31:49,625 --> 02:31:51,875
Death penalty!

1263
02:32:17,333 --> 02:32:20,875
Sarman!

1264
02:32:21,667 --> 02:32:24,875
The water is flowing
over the Dam!

1265
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,042
Do not be afraid!
Listen to me carefully!

1266
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:39,375
Take your belongings
and go to the River Gate.

1267
02:32:39,708 --> 02:32:43,000
Take your livestock with you
but leave the carts behind.

1268
02:32:44,083 --> 02:32:47,792
Everyone, we will have to
leave Mohenjo Daro!

1269
02:32:49,917 --> 02:32:52,083
The river can
no longer be stopped.

1270
02:32:52,875 --> 02:32:55,833
It will break the dam
and take a new course...

1271
02:32:56,125 --> 02:32:58,708
and in its wake,
Mohenjo Daro will be destroyed.

1272
02:32:58,792 --> 02:33:03,333
There is very little time, go now!
Get your things! Go!

1273
02:33:15,583 --> 02:33:19,083
What you started,
will be your undoing!

1274
02:33:19,583 --> 02:33:23,083
Take me with you!

1275
02:33:23,583 --> 02:33:27,667
Sarman,
how can you leave me here?

1276
02:33:30,875 --> 02:33:32,792
How can you leave me?

1277
02:33:32,875 --> 02:33:35,333
How can you leave me and go?!

1278
02:33:35,417 --> 02:33:38,875
Sarman!

1279
02:33:43,292 --> 02:33:47,500
The beginning of the New Sindhu Order!

1280
02:34:20,833 --> 02:34:23,083
We are here. We have
to make our way there.

1281
02:34:23,292 --> 02:34:25,333
The flow of the water
took the hay bale here...

1282
02:34:25,583 --> 02:34:29,625
which means we have to drop
the boats in the water over here.

1283
02:34:29,792 --> 02:34:32,917
We have to somehow take a rope
to the other end and get it back.

1284
02:34:34,542 --> 02:34:37,625
No matter what, we have to take
the people to safety, up on that hill.

1285
02:34:40,625 --> 02:34:44,500
We will have to make a boat bridge,
from this bank to that one.

1286
02:34:45,458 --> 02:34:48,875
Chief of Miners,
I need lots of rope, gather it.

1287
02:34:49,417 --> 02:34:51,417
Lothar,
you will stay here.

1288
02:34:51,625 --> 02:34:55,250
Uncle Durjan, bring the fittest of
the Zebu bulls to the Main Gate.

1289
02:34:55,625 --> 02:35:00,583
Hojo, get me bullcart wheels,
at least four.

1290
02:35:00,917 --> 02:35:02,875
And assemble all the boats here!

1291
02:35:03,083 --> 02:35:05,875
There is very little time! Go!
Go quickly!

1292
02:35:10,833 --> 02:35:14,333
Mother Sindhu!
Protect us!

1293
02:35:54,708 --> 02:36:00,125
Hurry! Do not leave the rope!
Row faster!

1294
02:36:01,333 --> 02:36:02,583
Hurry!

1295
02:36:27,250 --> 02:36:28,333
Sarman!

1296
02:36:29,042 --> 02:36:30,792
Hojo!
Pull!

1297
02:36:38,625 --> 02:36:40,458
We still have to take
this rope to that side.

1298
02:36:42,417 --> 02:36:45,625
Tie here...
Sarman, be careful!

1299
02:37:48,667 --> 02:37:52,208
- Tie this rope over there.
- Right.

1300
02:37:52,292 --> 02:37:56,583
Lothar! Remove this,
tie it to the first boat.

1301
02:37:57,792 --> 02:37:59,083
Tie it, quick!

1302
02:37:59,625 --> 02:38:01,250
Give more slack!

1303
02:38:07,375 --> 02:38:09,917
- Quickly!
- Bring it!

1304
02:38:11,583 --> 02:38:13,042
Hurry up and turn it!

1305
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:33,250
- Everyone ready?
- Yes!

1306
02:38:59,625 --> 02:39:02,583
Lothar... pull!

1307
02:39:02,667 --> 02:39:04,833
Boats in the water!

1308
02:39:04,917 --> 02:39:07,250
Pull... pull...

1309
02:39:19,042 --> 02:39:20,792
Pull...

1310
02:39:20,875 --> 02:39:23,042
Keep the rope straight.

1311
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,458
Pull...

1312
02:40:07,083 --> 02:40:09,250
Pull...

1313
02:40:28,458 --> 02:40:29,833
Pull...

1314
02:40:47,042 --> 02:40:49,083
Do not let go!

1315
02:41:03,125 --> 02:41:05,625
LockiL

1316
02:41:15,833 --> 02:41:19,250
It's done... let's go... it's done!

1317
02:41:20,208 --> 02:41:22,417
Many many thanks!

1318
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:44,583
Quickly... quickly!

1319
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:50,542
Uncle Durjan,
you and Hojo stay this side.

1320
02:41:51,083 --> 02:41:53,208
Lothar, come with me.

1321
02:42:02,042 --> 02:42:03,708
Come on!

1322
02:42:04,083 --> 02:42:06,375
Let's go!
Move faster!

1323
02:42:20,292 --> 02:42:22,875
Move faster!

1324
02:42:29,708 --> 02:42:30,833
Carefully!

1325
02:42:35,875 --> 02:42:37,250
Keep walking!

1326
02:42:54,667 --> 02:42:57,292
Hurry... hurry...

1327
02:43:26,917 --> 02:43:30,458
Jakhiro! Come on!

1328
02:43:30,542 --> 02:43:33,125
No Sarman... you go!

1329
02:43:33,583 --> 02:43:36,833
I was born here
and I will die here.

1330
02:43:36,917 --> 02:43:41,250
No Jakhiro!
Listen to me, come on.

1331
02:43:41,333 --> 02:43:47,292
This is my privilege,
the privilege to watch Maham die!

1332
02:43:50,625 --> 02:43:55,917
<i>Jakkfwds Mohefiyo Dare,
Moherflo Bards Jakmro.</i>

1333
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,625
Sarman, are you alright?

1334
02:45:59,458 --> 02:46:01,833
Mohenjo Daro will rise again!

1335
02:48:37,250 --> 02:48:39,917
This water is clean, pure!

1336
02:48:42,500 --> 02:48:44,458
From now on,
this will be our homeland!

1337
02:49:20,833 --> 02:49:22,833
Sarman, what will be
the name of this river?
